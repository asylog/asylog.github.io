I decide to detach this blog from my personal GitHub account. If I don't want to use it to create/enhance any public appearance, why can't I just keep the anonymity and avoid being watched? 所以新注册了一个账号。

我读建筑研究生时，毕业设计做了个不太“正常”的 proposal，为的是希望任何观点都能自由表达和被保护。后来方案取名叫 asylum for deviant ideas。这里 asylog 的全称就是 asylum log，仿佛就是那个方案的延续 after all these years.

Now it is more like an architecture project. Great.
